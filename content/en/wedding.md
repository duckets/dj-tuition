### DJ at your own wedding! 

A bride or groom DJing at their own wedding can be an energetic, memorable, and personalized highlight, especially if it's a surprise to your family and friends on the day.

Whether you've had previous music experience, or are an absolute beginner, I will lead you through a crash course learning everything you need to know to pull off a smooth set with some killer transitions and drops.

You'll learn how to mix, and I'll help you select songs, find remixes, and curate and rehearse your set list so that you'll feel confident on the day to wow your guests. 

-------------------------

### Details

This flexible and customised package is designed to help you deliver a short but memorable moment during your wedding day, rather than learning the skills required to DJ for an extended amount of time throughout your event.

For that reason, this package works best if you have a DJ arranged for your wedding who will bring the equipment, and you should negotiate with them a short timeslot during the evening where you can bring your own songs and jump on their decks. This way the equipment including decks, sound system, mixer, etc is all set up by a professional and ready to go.

My recommendation for a good balance is to aim for between a fifteen to thirty minute set, which could cover anywhere from six to fifteen songs or so. It's also worth bearing in mind the amount of time you're happy to be away from your guests.

- Ten hours for tuition, coaching and rehearsal, split into multiple two & one-hour sessions.
- Help and advice on selecting and acquiring songs, including finding the best remixes and versions suitable for DJing.
- Curating your final playlist, helping you rehearse it, and providing feedback on your practice and progress between lessons.
