Whether you've had previous music experience, or are an absolute beginner, I will lead you through a crash course learning everything you need to know.

You'll learn how to use the equipment, blend and mix tunes together, and I'll help you curate and rehearse your set so that you'll feel confident on the day.

### Wedding Package Details

This flexible and customised package is designed to give you the skills to take control of the decks for a memorable moment during your wedding day. You'll want to keep it relatively short so you can get back to the party - we will aim for between a fifteen to thirty minute set, which could cover anywhere from six to twelve songs or so. 

This package is based around you having a DJ arranged for your wedding who will bring the equipment. You can put me in touch with them, and we will negotiate together a short timeslot during the reception where you can bring your own songs and jump on their decks. This way your wedding DJ won't be surprised by an out-of-the-blue request on the day, and the equipment including decks, sound system, mixer, etc is all set up by a professional and ready to go.
