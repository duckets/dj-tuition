**DJ Experience**
![Boomtown 2025](/images/boomtown2025.jpg)

I've been DJing for around half a decade, progressing through bedroom DJ, house parties, weddings, birthdays, all the way to playing at [**Boomtown**](https://www.boomtownfair.co.uk/) and Brighton's legendary [**Volks club**](https://volksclub.co.uk/).

**Technical music knowledge**

My DJing started as an accompaniment to producing music, which I've been doing for as long as I can remember. I started on 8 bit computers and sample trackers in the 80s and 90s, and I'm now using Acid and Ableton to produce DnB, rave and UK bass remixes and original tracks which you can [check out on my SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/robotduck) along with some of my DJ sets.

**Training and communication**

I've also had a long professional career of what could be summarised as "explaining stuff". I've been a technical writer, trainer, consultant and course designer in various fields including game design, 3D modelling, programming, and even teaching kids to swim!

This unusual combination of experience makes me an expert musical and technical communicator, allowing me to understand your needs, create learning goals, and ensure you get the most out of our sessions together.
