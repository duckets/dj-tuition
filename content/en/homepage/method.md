You may have noticed DJ courses online and in person have very similar content - covering the hardware, software, music selection and preparation, mixing, effects, beatmatching, phrasing, etc. But what's more important is *how* it's taught.

DJing is evolving all the time, and many people new to it are not interested in aiming for the traditional goals of playing at clubs and weddings, etc. So rather than running through a pre-set curriculum, my style of tuition leans towards flexibility and creativity, laying out pathways but guided by you, going where you want to go and learning the things you want to learn.

My method follows this pattern:

  - **Consultation:**  
    A chat about your experience so far, the music you're interested in, and your goals for DJing. (Either online, or in-person as part of your intro session)
    
  - **Intro Session:**  
    We get started fast with some fun basics, or springboard straight from your current skill level in some fun new directions.
      
  - **Setting Goals:**  
    We decide some goals designed to boost your skills in the direction you want to take them, if you have your own equipment to practice on at home. If not, we can still set goals around watching, listening to, and learning from, aspirational DJ sets and techniques from DJs online. After each session I provide a summary of what we covered to help you remember and practice in your own time.
      
  - **Follow-up & Progression:**  
    In subsequent sessions we follow up on your progress, advance to new areas that suit you, and continue on your path to DJing towards the technical knowledge, style, and ability you're aiming for!

My course focuses on the industry standard Pioneer (AlphaTheta) DJ gear.

Lessons are held in my Kemptown flat, which has a cosy fun vibe and lovely sea views. I have both the beginner-level DDJ-400 decks and the more professional XDJ-XZ, allowing you to both use what you are more familiar with at home and see how features change with the full size layout of more professional equipment.
