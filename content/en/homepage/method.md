You've probably already noticed that most DJ courses whether online or in person have very similar content - hardware, software, music selection and preparation, mixing, effects, beatmatching, phrasing, etc. I'm no different, but what's more important is *how* it's taught.

Rather than running through a pre-set curriculum, my unique style of tuition leans towards flexibility and creativity, going where you want to go and learning the things you want to learn.

In addition to half a decade of DJing (including playing at Boomtown, and Brighton's legendary Volks club), I've had a long professional career of what could be summarised as "explaining stuff" (as technical writer, trainer, consultant and course designer) and I've been producing music for as long as I can remember. This unusual combination makes me an expert musical and technical communicator and able to understand your needs, create learning goals, and ensure you get the most out of our sessions together.

My method follows this pattern:

  - **Constultation:**  
    A chat about your experience so far, the music you're interested in, and your goals for DJing. (Either online, or in-person as part of your intro session)
    
  - **Intro Session:**  
    We get started fast with some fun basics, or springboard straight from your current skill level in some fun new directions.
      
  - **Setting Goals:**  
    We decide some goals designed to boost your skills in the direction you want to take them, if you have your own equipment to practice on at home. If not, we can still set goals around watching, listening to, and learning from, aspirational DJ sets and techniques from DJs online.
      
  - **Follow-up & Progression:**  
    We follow up on your progress and continue helping you on your path to DJing towards the technical knowledge, style, and ability you're aiming for!
