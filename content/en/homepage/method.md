You may have noticed DJ courses online and in person have very similar content - covering the hardware, software, music selection and preparation, mixing, effects, beatmatching, phrasing, etc. But what's more important is *how* it's taught.

Rather than running through a pre-set curriculum, my lessons lean toward flexibility and creativity, laying out pathways but guided by you, going where you want to go and learning the things you want to learn.

My method follows this pattern:

  - **Consultation:**  
    A half hour chat about your experience so far, the music you're interested in, and your goals for DJing. (Either online, or in-person before your first session)
    
  - **First Session:**  
    A full hour getting started fast with some fun basics, or springboarding straight from your current skill level in some fun new directions.
      
  - **Setting Goals:**  
    We decide some goals designed to boost your skills in the direction you want to take them, if you have your own equipment to practice on at home. If not, we can still set goals around watching, listening to, and learning from, aspirational DJ sets and techniques from DJs online. After each session I provide a summary of what we covered to help you remember and practice in your own time.
      
  - **Follow-up & Progression:**  
    In subsequent sessions we follow up on your progress, advance to new areas that suit you, and continue on your path to DJing towards the technical knowledge, style, and ability you're aiming for!

My course focuses on the industry standard **Pioneer** DJ gear. *(now known as [AlphaTheta](https://alphatheta.com/en/information/alphatheta-corporation-parent-company-change/))*

Lessons are held in my Kemptown flat, which has a cosy fun vibe and lovely sea views. I have both the beginner-level DDJ-400 decks and the more professional XDJ-XZ, allowing you to both use what you might be more familiar with at home, and experience how features translate to the full size layout of professional level equipment.
